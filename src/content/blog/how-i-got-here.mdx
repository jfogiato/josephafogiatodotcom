## Childhood

I think it's important to at least set _some_ context for the story below.

I grew up in a small town outside of Pittsburgh. My mom went to college (she was a teacher), but my dad was a tradesman and learned everything on the job (from _his_ dad). My mom passed away when I Was 15, so by the time 17 rolled around and it was time to start thinking about college, my dad and I were a bit our of our depths. So, I did what any reasonable 17 year old would do: I copied my older brother!

## College

I enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh in the College of Business Administration and started out as a finance major. Freshman year was pure hell (I had no study habits due to being a "get-straight-A's-without-doing-all-that-much" kid in highschool), and I just barely passed both semesters.

I (barely) came back sophomore year as an exercise science major (I was bodybuilding at the time) and lasted a whole 3 days into the semester before I realized it wasn't for me. I went back to my counselor and enrolled in a few accounting courses, and one other business pre-rec, and decided....well....to get my shit together. I learned how to learn, figured out what "knowing something" actually means, and got through the next 3 years with a 3.8 GPA.

That same year, I landed an internship with [GNC](https://www.fogiato.com/work#:~:text=GNC) in "merchandising". I had no idea what that was, but I had worked in GNC stores and figured I could figure the rest out. I ended up being there for the rest of college, and eventually made my way back there after a few job hops post-grad.

I took a [Visual Basic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)>) course my senior year and really enjoyed it, but I was about to graduate, so I didn't pursue it much further.

> The theme so far is this: not much effort or thoughtfulness involved - mostly just "falling" into things. Privelage, luck, and some resourcefullness got me through.

## The Journey

So here we are, circa 2017 - a good job, decent pay, easy work, but something's missing. I don't get much energy from my work. It's not very mentally engaging. I'm not connected to the mission (anymore - I definitely cared more about supplements when I was still bodybuilding). I knew I wanted to do something else, but didn't know what.

And so, I started looking.

I started getting into politics around this point, so I thought maybe a masters in public policy would be the move (I'm more jaded about policy now, but I still find it interesting). I talked to friends, and friends-of-friends, and gathered as much information as I could.

I started taking [photos](https://www.fogiato.com/film) as well, and thought maybe I could do that full time. I even had a couple gigs (and still do occasionally), but I didn't have the energy, connections, or desire to make it full time. Once you make a hobby a career, you lose some of what really drew you to it in the first place.

I like design, so I [redacted] a copy of the Adobe Suite and started learning how to use it. I made a few things, but nothing really stuck. I was still working full time, and I didn't have the time or energy to really dive into it. I also briefly considered a degree in industrial design, but it seemed too harrowing and out-of-my-wheelhouse.

I considered the trades, too. I love working with my hands, and worked with my dad each summer since I was 13. But a life in the trades is _hard_, and I saw what it did to my dad's body.

I thought data science/analytics may have been the right fit. I took some online courses and enjoyed them, but didn't know quite where to go with it.

And all this searching wasn't without a cost - I lived my life pretty minimally and kept my overhead light. I saved as much as I could in the hopes that some day I'd find "my thing" and have the resources to pursue it. It was also mentally taxing - I was constantly thinking about what I wanted to do, and was getting a bit burnt out from working at GNC for so long.

In 2019, I moved to Philadelphia and decided that it would be a fresh start. I prioritized looking for mission-driven work (while also still exploring a potential graduate degree), and eventually found it at [MANNA](<https://www.fogiato.com/work#:~:text=MANNA%20(Metropolitan%20Area%20Neighborhood%20Nutrition%20Alliance)>). That role filled my cup until it overflowed. I found myself on the "frontlines" during the pandemic, and eventually realized that I was burnt out and couldn't keep doing what I was doing.

> I explored lots of different things, but nothing seemed to be the right fit. I was still searching for something that would give me the energy and fulfillment I was looking for.

## The Inflection Point

It wasn't until my role at [Imperfect Foods](https://www.fogiato.com/work#:~:text=Imperfect%20Foods) that it really clicked for me - _I love building stuff that helps people._

Through talking with a handful of software engineers in the org, I came to find out that they had all gone to bootcamps. Not only that, they all went to the _same_ bootcamp - [Turing](https://www.fogiato.com/work#:~:text=Turing%20School%20of%20Software%20%26%20Design). Suddenly, I had this pretty viable option in front of me - 7 months, several thousand dollars, and a job at the end of it. I was sold. I applied, got in, and started in November of 2022.

The days were long, but the months were short. I put in 70+ hours a week, soaked up as much as I could, and made some incredible friends. At times, I felt completely out of my depth, but when it "clicked", I could feel it. I finally felt like I found "my thing".

## The Search

I graduated in June of 2023 and started the job search. For those not in tech, the market started to turn in late 2022/early 2023. There were mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and a general sense of uncertainty. Further, when there are layoffs, the market becomes saturated with talent. Trying to get a foot in the door with 0 experience is hard enough, but when there are thousands of other people with years of experience looking for the same job, it becomes even harder.

I applied to probably
